This tool can convert your java acceptance tests source code in a readable documentation. 

Usage:

Write your junit 4 tests with the following syntax:

@Test
public void shouldReturnedToStock() {
    givenACustomerBuysABlackJumper();
    whenHeReturnsTheJumperForARefund();
    thenIShouldHaveFourBlackJumpersInStock();
}

Then convert this source code to a HTML documentation:

java -jar bdd-doc-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all-dep.jar path/to/your/test/src html/doc/output/directory

Example output:

returned to stock

Given a customer buys a black jumper
when he returns the jumper for a refund
then I should have four black jumpers in stock
