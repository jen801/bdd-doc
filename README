This Java 6 Annotation Processor can convert your Java acceptance tests source code in a readable documentation. 

Usage:

Write your Junit 4 tests with the following syntax:

@Test
public void shouldShowsOneRegistrationAs1%() {
    givenAGoalOf200Registrations();

    when1AttendeeRegisters();

    thenEnsureTheGoalShouldBe1%Achieved();

}

Then compile this source code with the annotation processor in the classpath and you get a readable HTML documentation:

javac -cp bdd-doc-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all-dep.jar -s html/doc/output/directory YourTestClass.java

Example output:

Shows one registration as 1%

Given a goal of 200 registrations
When 1 attendee registers
Then the goal should be 1% achieved
